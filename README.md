# Woofer - tinder for dogs
This project was developed during my internship at Polpharma company using Visual Studio ASP.NET MVC architecture for the backend and React for the frontend. With Woofer, users can like and swap dogs they want to play with their own dog, as well as add, edit, and delete dogs from the database. Additionally, I added a Tic Tac Toe game with cats and dogs. 

To run this project you need to have installed:
-Visual Studio 2019
-.NET Framework 4.7.2
-Node.js
-MS SQL Server

You need to change ConntectionStrings to your local database.
